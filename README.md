# Skateyay

We are aiming to connect skaters from different places, building a community for skaters and people who want to skate. 

The skating is not as common as other outdoor activities, like biking and hiking. It is still a prevalent sport in Canada. However, none of the top10 skating friendly cities are in Canada. This application has mission to bring skaters together and build a strong and connected skating community.
